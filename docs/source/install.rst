Installation Guide
=====

It is recommended to create a virtual environment before installing RNA2seg to isolate dependencies:  

.. code-block:: console  

   $ python -m venv rna2seg-env  
   $ source rna2seg-env/bin/activate 

Then, install RNA2seg and its dependencies:  

.. code-block:: console  

   (rna2seg-env) $ pip install rna2seg  
   (rna2seg-env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt  

RNA2seg is now installed and ready to use. ðŸš€
